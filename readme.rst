Mathematics and Applications of Machine Learning
================================================

* Lecturer: Dirk - Andr√© Deckert
* Time: Wednesday, 14:00-16:00
* Location: Lecture Hall A 027

Description
-----------

This course will give an introduction to selected topics on machine learning.
We will start from the basic perceptron and proceed with support vector
machines, multi-layer networks, and aspects of deep learning. The mathematical
discussion will focus on machine learning as an optimization problem. As
regards applications, it is the goal of this lecture and its tutorials to
implement several applications of the discussed algorithms in Python.
Therefore, basic knowledge in Python programming and access to a computer with
a Python development environment is expected -- and will be required to
complete the exercises. If time permits and depending on the interest, we may
furthermore discuss aspects of recurrent networks and reinforcement learning.
