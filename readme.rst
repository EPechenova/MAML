Mathematics and Applications of Machine Learning
================================================

* **Institution:** Mathematical Institute, LMU Munich
* **Term:** Winter semester 2016/17
* **Lecturer:** Dirk - Andre Deckert, deckert@math.lmu.de
* **Time:** Wednesday, 14:00-16:00
* **Location:** Lecture Hall A 027

Description
-----------

This course will give an introduction to selected topics on machine learning.
We will start from the basic perceptron and proceed with support vector
machines, multi-layer networks, and aspects of deep learning. The mathematical
discussion will focus on machine learning as an optimization problem. As
regards applications, it is the goal of this lecture and its tutorials to
implement several applications of the discussed algorithms in Python.
Therefore, basic knowledge in Python programming and access to a computer with
a Python development environment is expected -- and will be required to
complete the exercises. If time permits and depending on the interest, we may
furthermore discuss aspects of recurrent networks and reinforcement learning.

As always, these notes have been written in quite a haste during the semester
and will contain lots of typos. If you find a typo please help to improve these
notes and report it with a precise reference (URL, equation number, etc.) to my
email address above. To my students: This material is in most parts less
detailed than the discussion in the lecture. Please let me know if and where,
you feel the notes came too short. Thanks in advance!
