Mathematics and Applications of Machine Learning
================================================

* **Institution:** Mathematical Institute, LMU Munich
* **Term:** Summer Semester 2018
* **Lecturer:** Dirk - Andre Deckert, deckert@math.lmu.de
* **Lecture:** Wed 10-12, A027
* **Tutorials:** Wed 12-14, A027

Description 
-----------

This course will give an introduction to selected topics on machine learning.
We will start from the basic perceptron and proceed with support vector
machines, multi-layer networks, and aspects of deep learning. The mathematical
discussion will focus on machine learning as an optimization problem. As
regards applications, it is the goal of this lecture and its tutorials to
implement several applications of the discussed algorithms in Python.
Therefore, basic knowledge in Python programming and access to a computer with
a Python development environment is expected -- and will be required to
complete the exercises. If time permits and depending on the interest, we may
furthermore discuss aspects of recurrent networks and reinforcement learning.

About this course material
--------------------------

* **Purpose**: Originally I do not come from the field of artificial
  intelligence or machine learning. My main field of research is mathematical
  physics. Naturally, it may be asked why someone like me would give a course
  about machine learning. My intention is this: On the one hand, with today's
  computer resources and the access to large amounts of data, machine learning
  has regained its significance during the last decade. By now there are even
  many interesting applications in physics and likewise in other sciences.  On
  the other hand, mathematics has yet only scratched the surface of
  understanding some of the successful machine learning algorithms while many
  of these mathematical problems are closely related to ones that have been
  studied in great depth, e.g., in statistical mechanics, probability and
  optimization theory.  In view of this, I want to advertise for the
  mathematics and applications of machine learning in the fields of mathematics
  and physics and give an introduction in terms of 'our jargon'. Let us take as
  an example the following quote and sneak in the term *computer science*:

      "Ich kann es nun einmal nicht lassen, in diesem Drama von Mathematik und
      Physik – die sich im Dunkeln befruchten, aber von Angesicht zu Angesicht so
      gerne einander verkennen und verleugnen – die Rolle des (wie ich genugsam
      erfuhr, oft unerwünschten) Boten zu spielen." 
      
      -- Hermann Weyl, Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik, Hirzel, Leipzig 1928

* **Selection of material:** This lecture will not follow one particular
  text-book. Rather we will pick out topics from various sources here and
  there. I will try to cite these sources and references to the best of my
  knowledge. Please let me know if you feel an appropriate citation to books,
  papers, source code, media files, etc., is missing in which case I will add
  it.

* **Style:** As regards style, these notes are written in the form of roadmaps
  for the material discussed in class. Hence, in most parts this written
  material is less detailed than our discussion in class, however, should serve
  as a guide through the topics. I am happy about every feedback concerning 
  if and where you felt the notes came too short.
  
* **Typos:** As always, also these notes have been written in quite a haste
  during the semester and will contain lots of typos. If you find some please
  help to improve these notes by reporting them including precise references
  (URL, equation number, etc.) to my email address above. I will add a *hall of
  fame* for everyone who got involved improving these notes.
