Description 
-----------

This course will give an introduction to selected topics on machine learning.
We will start from the basic perceptron and proceed with support vector
machines, multi-layer networks, and aspects of deep learning. The mathematical
discussion will focus on machine learning as an optimization problem. As
regards applications, it is the goal of this lecture and its tutorials to
implement several applications of the discussed algorithms in Python.
Therefore, basic knowledge in Python programming and access to a computer with
a Python development environment is expected -- and will be required to
complete the exercises. If time permits and depending on the interest, we may
furthermore discuss aspects of recurrent networks and reinforcement learning.

About this course material
--------------------------

* **Purpose**: I am not a specialist in artificial intelligence or machine
  learning. My main area of research is mathematical physics. Naturally, It should
  then be asked why someone like me should give a course about machine
  learning. My intention is this: With today's computer resources and the
  amount of available data, machine learning has regained its significance
  during the last decade. On the one hand, regarding the huge amounts of data
  that for instance scattering experiments at the CERN or astronomical
  observations produce, machine learning will soon have an impact on physics
  and other sciences requiring efficient numerics and data analysis tools. On
  the other hand, mathematics has yet only scratched the surface of
  understanding some of the successful machine learning algorithms while many
  of these mathematical problems are closely related to ones that have been
  studied in, e.g., statistical mechanics and probability theory. In this
  sense, I want to advertise for the mathematics and applications of machine
  learning in our field with an introduction using 'our jargon'. 

      "Ich kann es nun einmal nicht lassen, in diesem Drama von Mathematik und
      Physik – die sich im Dunkeln befruchten, aber von Angesicht zu Angesicht so
      gerne einander verkennen und verleugnen – die Rolle des (wie ich genugsam
      erfuhr, oft unerwünschten) Boten zu spielen." 
      
      -- Hermann Weyl, Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik, Hirzel, Leipzig 1928

* **Selection of material:** This lecture will not follow one particular text-book.
  Rather we will pick out topics from various sources here and there. I will
  try to cite these sources and references to the best of my knowledge. Please
  let me know if you feel an appropriate citation to books, papers, source
  code, media files, etc., is missing in which case I will add it.

* **Style:** As regards style, these notes are written in the form
  of presentations which are discussed in class. Hence, in most parts this
  material is less detailed than our discussion, however, should serve as
  a good guide through the topics. I would be happy to received feedback
  concerning if and where you felt the notes came too short.
  
* **Typos:** As it is always the case, these notes have been written in quite
  a haste during the semester and will contain lots of typos. If you find some
  please help to improve these notes by reporting them including precise
  references (URL, equation number, etc.) to my email address above. I will add
  a *hall of fame* for everyone who got involved improving these notes.
