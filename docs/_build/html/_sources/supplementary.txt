Text-books and supplementary material
=====================================

The lecture will not follow one particular text-book. Rather we will pick out
some topics from here and there. However, the following references provide some
sources: 

* For a brief introduction into python see :cite:`gael_scipy_2016`. 
* Two standard references on *machine learning* are
  :cite:`bishop_pattern_2007` and :cite:`russell_artificial_2010`. 
* A really nice hands-on approach on deep learning is
  :cite:`nielsen_neural_2015`.  We will follow those notes a great deal. 
* Another good reference on *machine learning* with a more mathematical focus is
  :cite:`mohri_foundations_2012`.
