Nonlinear classification problems
=================================

Extension of Adaline
--------------------

.. todo:: Under construction. See for example :cite:`raschka_python_2015`.

    * Example for non-linear separable data that can be mapped to a higher dimensional feature space where the data becomes linear separable.

Kernel trick for Support Vector Machines
----------------------------------------

.. todo:: Under construction. See for example :cite:`vapnik_statistical_1998`, :cite:`mohri_foundations_2012`. 

    * Properties of kernels and relation between them and a mapping to a higher dimensional feature space. 
    * SVMs with Kernels and there advantages for non-linear problems.
    * Normalization of kernels.
